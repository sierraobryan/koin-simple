# koin-simple
Simple app to demonstrate using [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) for Dependency injection with [Mockk](https://mockk.io/) for testing framework. Shares basic functionality and architecture with the [hilt-simple repo](https://github.com/sierraobryan/hilt-simple) to compare and contrast usage with that of [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) as major DI options in native Android with Kotlin. Note this repo has some additional useless variables and empty functions added only to expand mockk testing examples.
